# Library Management System

This project is a Library Management System built using Flask and PostgreSQL. 
Initially, it was created as part of a capstone project for a Database Management course, but I decided to extend it further by adding a proper user interface to make it more functional and user-friendly.


The system allows users to manage typical library operations, such as user registration, book search, borrowing, returning, and handling overdue fees. It supports both clients (library members) and librarians for different functionalities.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Clients can sign up and log in to their accounts.
- **Search**: Search for books, magazines, and journal articles by title, author, or publisher.
- **Borrow & Return**: Borrow books and manage returns.
- **Overdue Fees**: Automatically calculate and apply overdue fees for late returns.
